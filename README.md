# Authentication

Learning authentication and Express/database connections.

### Solved issues:

- Created routes for index, login, logout, and signup
- User can signup and have profile added to database and be welcomed by name.
- Wrote function to find user by email when they attempt a login.
- Encrypted password before saving to database.
- Wrote function that verifies password after checking for user.
- Emptied database of test users with unencrypted passwords.
- Masked password when being typed into field.

### Unsolved issues:

- Need to fix error handling on unknown user so error is handled by a route in app.js and not a catch block in queries.js
